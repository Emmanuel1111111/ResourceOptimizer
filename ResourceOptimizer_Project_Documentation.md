### Construction

#### System Logic Implementation

**1. Authentication System**

```typescript
// Frontend Authentication Service
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class AdminAuthService {
  private currentUserSubject = new BehaviorSubject<AdminUser | null>(null);
  public currentUser$ = this.currentUserSubject.asObservable();

  loginAdmin(credentials: LoginRequest): Observable<LoginResponse> {
    return this.http.post<LoginResponse>(`${this.apiUrl}/admin/login`, credentials)
      .pipe(
        tap(response => {
          sessionStorage.setItem('access_token', response.token);
          sessionStorage.setItem('refresh_token', response.refreshToken);
          this.currentUserSubject.next(response.user);
        })
      );
  }
}
```

```python
# Backend Authentication Blueprint
@admin_auth_bp.route('/admin/login', methods=['POST'])
def admin_login():
    data = request.get_json()
    username = data.get('username')
    password = data.get('password')
    
    # Validate user credentials
    user = validate_admin_credentials(username, password)
    if not user:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Invalid credentials'}), 401
    
    # Generate JWT tokens
    access_token = create_access_token(identity=user['_id'])
    refresh_token = create_refresh_token(identity=user['_id'])
    
    return jsonify({
        'token': access_token,
        'refreshToken': refresh_token,
        'user': user
    })
```

**2. Resource Management System**

```typescript
// Resource Management Service
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class ResourceManagementService {
  checkOverlap(roomId: string, date: string, startTime: string, endTime: string): Observable<any> {
    const params = { room_id: roomId, date, start_time: startTime, end_time: endTime };
    return this.http.get(`${this.API_BASE_URL}/check_overlap`, { params });
  }

  suggestRooms(capacity: number, date: string, startTime: string, endTime: string): Observable<any> {
    const params = { capacity, date, start_time: startTime, end_time: endTime };
    return this.http.get(`${this.API_BASE_URL}/suggest_rooms`, { params });
  }
}
```

```python
# Backend Resource Management
@app.route('/check_overlap', methods=['GET'])
def check_overlap():
    room_id = request.args.get('room_id')
    date = request.args.get('date')
    start_time = request.args.get('start_time')
    end_time = request.args.get('end_time')
    
    # Query existing schedules
    existing_schedules = schedules_collection.find({
        'room_id': room_id,
        'date': date,
        '$or': [
            {
                'start_time': {'$lt': end_time},
                'end_time': {'$gt': start_time}
            }
        ]
    })
    
    overlaps = list(existing_schedules)
    return jsonify({'overlaps': overlaps, 'has_overlap': len(overlaps) > 0})
```

**3. Real-time Notification System**

```typescript
// Notification Service
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class NotificationService {
  private pollingInterval: any;

  startPolling(): void {
    this.pollingInterval = setInterval(() => {
      this.getNotifications().subscribe();
    }, 30000); // Poll every 30 seconds
  }

  createNotification(notificationData: any): Observable<any> {
    return this.http.post(`${this.apiUrl}/admin/notifications/create`, notificationData);
  }
}
```

```python
# Backend Notification Service
class NotificationService:
    def create_notification(self, admin_id: str, type: str, title: str, message: str, data: Dict = None) -> str:
        notification = {
            "_id": ObjectId(),
            "admin_id": admin_id,
            "type": type,
            "title": title,
            "message": message,
            "data": data or {},
            "read": False,
            "created_at": datetime.utcnow(),
            "is_active": True
        }
        result = self.notifications_collection.insert_one(notification)
        return str(result.inserted_id)

  beforeEach(async () => {
    await TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      declarations: [ AdminDashboardComponent ],
      providers: [ AdminAuthService, NotificationService ]
    }).compileComponents();
  });

  it('should load dashboard data on initialization', () => {
    spyOn(component, 'loadDashboardData');
    component.ngOnInit();

    user_data = {
        'username': 'test.admin',
        'email': 'test@example.com',
        'password': 'TestPass123!',
        'role': 'admin'
    }
    
    result = create_admin_user(user_data)
    assert result['success'] == True
    assert result['user_id'] is not None

def test_overlap_detection():
    # Test overlap detection logic
    room_id = 'SCB-SF20'
    date = '2025-01-27'
    start_time = '10:00'
    end_time = '12:00'

    assert login_response.status_code == 200
    
    # 2. Check room availability
    availability_response = check_room_availability('SCB-SF20', '2025-01-27')
    assert availability_response.status_code == 200
    
    # 3. Create booking
    booking_data = {
        'room_id': 'SCB-SF20',
        'date': '2025-01-27',
        'start_time': '10:00',

        'course': 'Computer Science',
        'department': 'IT',
        'lecturer': 'Dr. Smith'
    }
    booking_response = create_booking(booking_data)
    assert booking_response.status_code == 201
    
    # 4. Verify notification creation
    notifications = get_notifications()
    assert len(notifications) > 0
```

**Algorithm for Validation Testing**

```python
# System Validation Testing
def test_security_requirements():
    # Test authentication requirements
    unauthorized_response = access_protected_endpoint()
    assert unauthorized_response.status_code == 401
    
    # Test role-based access
    regular_user_response = access_admin_endpoint('regular_user')
    assert regular_user_response.status_code == 403
    
    # Test MFA requirements
    mfa_response = login_without_mfa('admin.super')
    assert mfa_response.status_code == 400

def test_performance_requirements():
    # Test response time
    start_time = time.time()
    response = load_dashboard_data()
    end_time = time.time()
    
    response_time = end_time - start_time
    assert response_time < 2.0  # Should respond within 2 seconds
    
    # Test concurrent users
    concurrent_responses = test_concurrent_users(10)
    assert all(response.status_code == 200 for response in concurrent_responses)
